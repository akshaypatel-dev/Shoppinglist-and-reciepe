    "description" : "This simple, seasonal recipe teams up seared chicken and brown rice, loaded with late-summer vegetables.

Juicy tomatoes (yours may be red or yellow) and basil seeds marinated in vinegar top off the rice with pops of delicious brightness. (Chefs, your basil seeds will turn white when marinated!)",
